# ðŸš§ Under Heavy Construction ðŸš§

Definetely not yet ready for production use.

I'll tag/release an alpha/beta as soon as things are more reliable and there are adequete tests.

If you're curious, use the GitHub "Watch" feature (near the star button) and choose "Custom" -> "Releases" to be notified of releases when they happen.

#### Requires Swift 6.2. Also requires macOS 26 if used on macos.

# swift-dns

A Swift DNS library built on top of SwiftNIO; aiming to provide DNS client, resolver and server implementations.

## Usage

Initialize a `DNSClient`, then use the `query` methods:

```swift
import DNSClient
import DNSModels

/// Create a `DNSClient`
let client = DNSClient(
    serverAddress: .domain(name: "8.8.4.4", port: 53),
    logger: Logger(label: "DNSTests")
)

/// Send the query
let response = try await client.queryA(
    message: .forQuery(name: "example.com"),
    options: .edns
) /// type of value is `Message`

/// Read the answers
for answer in response.answers {
    let a = try answer.rdata /// type of value is `A`
    let ipv4 = a.value /// type of value is `IPv4Address`
    print("Got ipv4 \(ipv4) for domain \(response.queries.first?.name.description ?? "n/a")")
}
```

## Checklist
